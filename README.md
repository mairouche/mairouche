Hey there 👋

I’m Meidi, a software engineer.

I spend most of my time building backend systems and cloud-based applications that are reliable, scalable, and easy to maintain.
I enjoy working close to the code while still caring about system design, data flows, and how things behave in production.

This profile is where I share small projects, experiments, POCs, and things I’m currently exploring.
Nothing polished — just real work and curiosity-driven code.
