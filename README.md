Hey there 👋

I’m Meidi, a software engineer.

I spend most of my time building backend systems and cloud-based applications that are reliable, scalable, and easy to maintain.
I enjoy working close to the code while still caring about system design, data flows, and how things behave in production.

This profile is where I share small projects, experiments, POCs, and things I’m currently exploring.
Nothing polished — just real work and curiosity-driven code.

### Tools & Tech

- Backend: Java, Node.js, Python  
- Cloud: AWS, GCP  
- Infra & DevOps: Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD  
- Data & AI: Data platforms, LLMs, RAG, vector databases  
- Architecture: event-driven systems, microservices, serverless

### A bit about me

- I like clean, readable code and simple designs  
- I care about how systems behave in production, not just how they look on paper  
- Not a fan of over-engineering  
- I enjoy debugging, understanding failures, and fixing root causes  
- Curious by nature — I learn by building and breaking things
